# PROTECT THE STREAMS: THE WHITE-PAPER
**Uplink Version: 1.0.0 | Signal Status: SECURE**

---

## 1. VISION & PROJECT OVERVIEW
**PROTECT THE STREAMS (PTS)** is a high-stakes, cyberpunk tactical RPG built on the Solana blockchain. In a future where corporate conglomerates have monopolized the "Neural Feed," the only remains of human culture exist within the fragmented data-streams of the **Great Creators**.

Players take on the role of **Uplink Commanders** in the Resistance. Your mission: liberate the digitized consciousness of legendary streamers (IShowSpeed, Kai Cenat, Duke Dennis, and more) from the clutches of the **Global Value Authority**.

## 2. PROJECT GOALS
- **Preserve the Culture**: Archive the digital spirits of creators as immortal blockchain assets.
- **Decentralize the Feed**: Break the corporate monopoly on attention and entertainment.
- **Rewarding Strategy**: Create a deep, turn-based combat system where skill, nature modifiers, and item management determine the success of the rebellion.
- **Interoperability**: Establish a universe where creator assets are more than just static images—they are living, leveling combatants.

## 3. THE THEME: CYBER-REBELLION
The world of PTS is bathed in neon and static. It is a world of **High Tech / Low Life**.
- **The Resistance**: A decentralized collective using "Ghost Servers" and "Uplink Terminals."
- **The Authority**: A cold, algorithmic entity that views creators as "Signal Assets" to be mined for efficiency.
- **Visual Aesthetic**: 2D Anime-style sprites fused with glitch-heavy HUDs, CRT-scanlines, and vibrant neon gradients.

## 4. HOW TO PLAY (MECHANICS)

### A. The Strategic Map
The grid is divided into sectors, each controlled by an Authority Sentinel. Players must navigate the map, respond to random **Signal Flares** or **Data Sweeps**, and choose which sector to liberate next.

### B. Turn-Based Tactical Combat
Battles are held in the **Mission Terminal**.
- **Move Types**: Moves are categorized into **CHAOS, REBELLION, INTEL, CHARISMA, and INFLUENCE**.
- **Type Effectiveness**: Strategic mastery requires exploiting the Authority's algorithmic weaknesses (e.g., Chaos disrupts static Intel).
- **Quantum Sync (Ultimate)**: As battle rages, the player's synchronization with the streamer increases. At 100% sync, execute a devastating **Ultimate Move**.
- **Natures**: Every secured streamer is assigned a unique **Nature** (Aggressive, Cunning, Rebellious, etc.) that fundamentally modifies their baseline stats.

### C. Leveling & XP
Successful missions grant **Neural XP**. Increasing a streamer's level improves their HP and stat output, allowing them to tackle higher **Global Threat Levels**.

## 5. THE ECONOMY: $PTS COIN
The Resistance is fueled by **$PTS**, a utility token launched on the Solana blockchain following strict **Fair Launch** protocols.

### A. Tokenomics Spec (Resistance Standard)
Following the efficiency protocols of the Solana grid (inspired by Pump.fun standards):
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 (1 Billion) $PTS.
- **Fair Launch**: No pre-sale, no team allocation, no "insider" signal. Every agent enters the grid at the same entry point.
- **Bonding Curve Mechanism**: $PTS operates on a linear bonding curve. As the community secures more supply, the value stabilizes until the **Liquidity Threshold** is reached.
- **Migration & Burn**: Upon reaching the critical market cap threshold (~$69k), liquidity is automatically migrated to the Raydium DEX, and the LP tokens are burned (permanently locked), ensuring a trustless, corporate-free economy.

### B. Future Utility
- **Black Market Items**: Buy high-tier Restore Chips, Attack Matrices, and rare Phoenix Modules.
- **Power Uplinks**: Unlock secondary and tertiary move slots for streamers.
- **Asset Modification**: Use $PTS to "re-roll" a streamer's Nature or upgrade their visual armor/trait quality.
- **Tournament Entry**: Participate in high-stakes Resistance Gauntlets for exclusive loot.

## 6. THE 2026 ROADMAP (REBELLION_PHASE)

### Q1 2026: THE GENESIS UPLINK
- **TGE (Token Generation Event)**: Deployment of $PTS on the Solana Mainnet via the bonding curve protocol.
- **Narrative Archives Phase 1**: Launch of unique origin storylines for the "Starter 5" streamers.
- **Neural Gear Drop**: Introduction of wearable vanity items and stat-boosting NFT cosmetics.

### Q2 2026: THE GLITCH MATCH ARENA
- **PvP Beta**: Launch of the simulated arena where Commanders can challenge each other for $PTS stakes.
- **League Integration**: Sector-based tournaments with corporate bounty rewards.
- **Governance Node**: $PTS holders begin voting on which "Real-World" creator to liberate next.

### Q3 2026: GLOBAL AUTHORITY SWEEP
- **World Boss Events**: Massive, time-limited raids against the "Authority Over-Arch" requiring community-wide coordination.
- **Mobile Terminal**: Native iOS/Android app deployment for on-the-go sector management.
- **Cross-Chain Signal**: Interoperability bridges for secondary asset migrations.

### Q4 2026: TOTAL SYSTEM LIBERATION
- **The Metaverse Bridge**: Integrating PTS assets into secondary 3D virtual worlds.
- **AI-Driven Storytelling**: Procedural mission generation based on real-time streamer activity.
- **$PTS Ecosystem Maturity**: Full integration of $PTS as a medium of exchange across the creator economy.
