# PROTECT THE STREAMS: THE WHITE-PAPER
**Uplink Version: 3.0.0 (GOLD) | Signal Status: 10/10 STABLE | Phase: TOTAL AUTHORITY**

---

## 1. FOUNDER'S FOREWORD
**"The signal is no longer just a flicker. It is a beam."**

When we started this resistance, the idea of digitizing soul-bound creators onto the Solana blockchain was just a theory. The critics called it "noise." The algorithms tried to suppress it. But we built `Protect The Streams` not just as a game, but as a statement.

Today, I can confirm that the system is **10/10 Stable**. The latency is zero. The vibes are immaculate. We have successfully bridged the gap between high-fidelity gaming and decentralized ownership. We didn't just build an app; we built a stronghold for digital culture.

This whitepaper outlines the architecture of our victory.
**- The Architect**

## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**PROTECT THE STREAMS (PTS)** is the ultimate cyberpunk tactical RPG on Solana. It fuses the adrenaline of creator culture with the immutability of blockchain technology.

In a dystopia where **Sentinel INC.** owns every pixel of the "Neural Feed," PTS gives power back to the people. Players become **Uplink Commanders**, recruiting digitized legends like **Rakai**, **Tylil**, and **QueenB** to fight for the future of the internet.
