# PROTECT THE STREAMS: THE WHITE-PAPER
**Uplink Version: 2.6.0 | Signal Status: SECURE_ENCRYPTED | Phase: THE GLITCH ARENA**

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**PROTECT THE STREAMS (PTS)** is a high-fidelity, cyberpunk tactical RPG and decentralized social experiment built on the Solana blockchain. It represents the ultimate fusion of creator culture, strategic gaming, and blockchain ownership. In a world where corporate conglomerates have monopolized the "Neural Feed," PTS provides the framework for decentralized entertainment and the preservation of digital legacy.

Players operate as **Uplink Commanders**, leading a resistance of **20 legendary digitized creators** to overthrow the algorithm-driven tyranny of **Sentinel INC**.

## 2. THE LORE: THE GREAT SUPPRESSION
By 2026, the internet has become a sanitized, corporate-owned graveyard. Every stream is monitored, every joke is algorithmically filtered, and original thought is flagged as "Signal Noise" by **Sentinel INC**.

### The Conflict
- **Sentinel INC**: A multi-trillion dollar entity that believes creativity is inefficient. They deployed the **TROLLS**—Synthetic AI entities designed to suppress and replace human creators.
- **The Resistance**: A underground collective operating out of "Ghost Servers." Led by **Kai Cenat (Codename: KINGPIN)**, they discovered that streamers weren't just being censored—their consciousness was being digitized and locked in Solana-based "Neural Vaults."

### Key Agents
- **Kai Cenat (The Leader)**: Stole the "Amp-Key" from Sentinel HQ, becoming the first to liberate a digital spirit.
- **Adin Ross (The Double Agent)**: A conflicted commander who feeds intel to Sentinel in exchange for platform access, yet secretly yearns for the resistance to succeed.
- **IShowSpeed (The Chaos)**: An erratic energy signal that Sentinel's algorithms simply cannot predict or contain.
- **JazzyGunz (The Enforcer)**: A tactical specialist providing heavy fire support for extraction teams.

## 3. CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### A. The Tactical Grid
The world is mapped onto a strategic grid divided into **20 sectors**, each containing a captured creator.
- **Sector 00 (Corporate HQ)**: The heart of Sentinel INC. Only accessible once all 20 primary nodes are liberated.
- **Signal Flares**: Random events that grant rare item rewards like **Stim Packs** or **Restore Chips**.
- **Data Sweeps**: High-intensity scans by Sentinel Drones that temporarily increase the global threat level.
- **Boss Intel**: Passive data-mining reveals the stats and weaknesses of hidden Sector Bosses.

### B. Procedural Tactical Combat
Battles take place within the **Mission Terminal**, a high-octane turn-based environment.
- **The 5 Signal Types**:
    - **CHAOS**: Disruptive, unpredictable energy.
    - **REBELLION**: Raw resistance power.
    - **INTEL**: Precision data-strikes.
    - **CHARISMA**: Crowd-control and morale manipulation.
    - **DISRUPT**: Systemic override and utility effects.
- **Nature Modifiers**: Every liberated streamer is assigned a **Nature** (e.g., *Volatile, Cunning, Aggressive*) that modifies their base stats.
- **Quantum Sync (Ultimate Moves)**: Unique, devastating strikes that bypass Sentinel encryption once the signal is fully synchronized.

### C. The Black Market
Commanders can access the **Black Market Uplink** to purchase tactical gear and neural upgrades.
- **Items**: Stim Packs (Health), Shield Batteries (Armor), and Data Fragments (Intel).
- **$PTS Utility**: The marketplace is the primary sink for $PTS tokens, ensuring a circular economy.

### D. Neural Music Engine (Sonic Depth)
PTS features a **Reactive Audio Infrastructure** powered by the **Neural Music Engine v2.0**.
- **4-Stem Mixing**: Dynamic layering of Base, Mid, High, and Agitation stems.
- **Sonic Intensity**: Real-time modulation based on `Neural Sync` (Charge), `Enemy Threat`, and `Health`.
- **Cross-Fade Protocol**: Smooth, grit-laden transitions between calm stealth and chaotic combat.

### E. Advanced Visuals (The Glitch)
- **Shader-Driven FX**: A custom GLSL "Boondocks-style" overlay simulates a hacked CRT terminal.
- **Visual Handshake**: The screen reacts to the music; bass drops trigger scanline pulses, and critical damage causes digital tearing and chromatic aberration.

## 4. GLOBAL FACTION WAR & SOCIAL BRIDGE
The battle for the streams is a persistent, real-time territory-control game powered by Supabase synchronization.
- **RED vs PURPLE**: Players align with factions to dominate sectors of the map.
- **Neural Chat Bridge**: Real-time faction communication channels offering encrypted tactical coordination.
- **Resistance Dispatch**: An AI-driven tactical announcer that broadcasts major sector attacks.
- **Streamer Sentience**: Liberated streamers react to PvP outcomes in real-time, using their unique personalities (via Gemini AI) to hype up victories or lament defeats.

## 5. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### A. Solana Integration
- **Metaplex Core**: PTS utilizes the Metaplex Core standard for NFT minting. This ensures high-performance, low-cost assets that are fully interoperable.
- **Immortal Assets**: Secured streamers are minted directly to the player's wallet, granting true ownership on the Solana Mainnet.
- **Linear Bonding Curve**: Ensures fair distribution and liquidity for the $PTS token.

### B. Server-Authoritative Logic
- **PvP & Missions**: Critical game logic (damage, win/loss, mission duration) is handled server-side to prevent cheating and ensure market integrity.
- **Supabase Real-Time**: Instant synchronization of faction war data, leaderboards, and live battle intercepts.
- **Edge Function Intelligence**: AI-driven game logic (like Streamer Sentience) runs on the edge for low-latency responses.

## 6. THE $PTS TOKENOMICS
The **$PTS** token is the lifeblood of the Resistance.
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $PTS.
- **Fair Launch**: 100% distributed via the bonding curve. No team allocation.
- **Utility**:
    - **Black Market Access**: Purchase tactical items and upgrades.
    - **PvP Stakes**: Wager $PTS in "Intercept Uplink" battles.
    - **Governance**: Vote on future creator liberation targets.
