# PROTECT THE STREAMS: THE WHITE-PAPER
**Uplink Version: 2.1.0 | Signal Status: SECURE_ENCRYPTED**

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
**PROTECT THE STREAMS (PTS)** is a high-fidelity, cyberpunk tactical RPG and decentralized social experiment built on the Solana blockchain. It represents the ultimate fusion of creator culture, strategic gaming, and blockchain ownership. In a world where corporate conglomerates have monopolized the "Neural Feed," PTS provides the framework for decentralized entertainment and the preservation of digital legacy.

Players operate as **Uplink Commanders**, leading a resistance of 20 legendary digitized creators to overthrow the algorithm-driven tyranny of **Sentinel INC**.

## 2. THE LORE: THE GREAT SUPPRESSION
By 2026, the internet has become a sanitized, corporate-owned graveyard. Every stream is monitored, every joke is algorithmically filtered, and original thought is flagged as "Signal Noise" by **Sentinel INC**.

### The Conflict
- **Sentinel INC**: A multi-trillion dollar entity that believes creativity is inefficient. They deployed the **TROLLS**—Synthetic AI entities designed to suppress and replace human creators.
- **The Resistance**: A underground collective operating out of "Ghost Servers." Led by **Kai Cenat (Codename: KINGPIN)**, they discovered that streamers weren't just being censored—their consciousness was being digitized and locked in Solana-based "Neural Vaults."

### Key Agents
- **Kai Cenat (The Leader)**: Stole the "Amp-Key" from Sentinel HQ, becoming the first to liberate a digital spirit.
- **Adin Ross (The Double Agent)**: A conflicted commander who feeds intel to Sentinel in exchange for platform access, yet secretly yearns for the resistance to succeed.
- **IShowSpeed (The Chaos)**: An erratic energy signal that Sentinel's algorithms simply cannot predict or contain.

## 3. CORE GAMEPLAY MECHANICS

### A. Strategic Grid Navigation
The world is mapped onto a tactical grid divided into 20 sectors. Each sector is guarded by an Authority Sentinel and holds a captured Creator node.
- **Signal Flares**: Random events that grant rare item rewards like **Stim Packs**.
- **Data Sweeps**: High-intensity scans that temporarily increase the global difficulty curve.
- **Intel Reveals**: Passive data-mining reveals the stats and weaknesses of hidden Sector Bosses.

### B. Procedural Tactical Combat
Battles take place within the **Mission Terminal**, a high-octane turn-based environment.
- **The 5 Signal Types**:
    - **CHAOS**: Disruptive, unpredictable energy (Strong against Intel).
    - **REBELLION**: Raw resistance power.
    - **INTEL**: Precision data-strikes.
    - **CHARISMA**: Crowd-control and morale manipulation.
    - **INFLUENCE**: Systemic override and indirect damage.
- **Nature Modifiers**: Every liberated streamer is assigned a **Nature** (e.g., *Volatile, Cunning, Defiant*) that permanently modifies their Influence, Chaos, Charisma, and Rebellion stats.
- **Quantum Sync (Ultimate moves)**: By maintaining a steady signal during battle, players unlock the **Ultimate Move**—a devastating strike that bypasses Sentinel encryption.

### C. Neural Music Engine
PTS features the world's first **Reactive Audio Infrastructure**. Built on the Web Audio API, the game's soundtrack is procedurally generated and reacts to the player's real-time performance.
- **Integrity Resonance**: As a player's HP (Integrity) drops, the background drone frequency shifts from 40Hz to 100Hz, and the sub-bass pulse rate accelerates to create a physiological sense of urgency.
- **Glitch Synthesis**: Critical health states trigger real-time noise-textures and "glitch" audio artifacts, simulating a failing neural link.

## 4. GLOBAL FACTION WAR
The battle for the streams isn't just local—it's global. Every mission completed contributes to the **Global Faction War**, a persistent territory-control game.
- **RED vs PURPLE**: Players align with factions to dominate sectors of the map.
- **Real-Time Synergy**: Using Supabase-powered network synchronization, the map visuals update in real-time as factions flip control points.
- **Control Modifiers**: Controlling a sector grants all allied commanders in that region specific stat buffs.

## 5. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### A. Solana Integration
- **Metaplex Core**: PTS utilizes the latest Metaplex Core standard for NFT minting. This ensures high-performance, low-cost assets that are fully interoperable.
- **Immortal Assets**: Secured streamers are minted directly to the player's wallet, granting true ownership and a permanent record of liberation on the Solana Mainnet.
- **Bonding Curve Economy**: $PTS utilizes a linear bonding curve to ensure fair distribution and liquidity safety.

### B. High-Performance Backend
- **Supabase Real-Time**: All player progress, faction war data, and leaderboards are synchronized via Supabase's real-time engine, ensuring a seamless multi-player experience without the lag of traditional databases.
- **AI-Driven Narrative**: Character backstories and mission logs are generated using LLM-integration, providing unique context for every liberated node.

## 6. THE $PTS TOKENOMICS
The **$PTS** token is the lifeblood of the Resistance.
- **Total Supply**: 1,000,000,000 $PTS.
- **Fair Launch**: 100% of supply is distributed via the bonding curve. No team allocation. No insiders.
- **Utility**:
    - **Black Market Access**: Purchase tactical items and "Restore Chips."
    - **Neural Upgrades**: Use $PTS to re-roll Nature modifiers or upgrade streamer move-sets.
    - **Governance**: Vote on which real-world creators the resistance should target next for digital liberation.
